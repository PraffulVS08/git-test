How do I run a git bash in a specific folder???
----------------
Type git bash in search.
Right click on it and choose open file location.
Right click on it and choose properties.
At target remove --cd-to-home from "C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe" --cd-to-home.
At start in put the path of the directory you want it to start at for example Start in: C:\Users\prafull\Desktop\git-test
------------------------------------
>git --help   [use to see all commands]
------------------------------------
>git init (enter)   [now current folder has been initialized to be git-repository, and also marked as *branch-master*]
        [git init   -> to create an empty git-repo]
>git status  (enter)  [to know current status(any modifications made in files) of folder, wil show all files of folder, initially no file added to git-repo]
>git add .  (enter)  [all files in current-directory will be added to staging-area of my git-repo]
              [git add    -> used to add files/folders to staging-area]
>git status  (enter)  [now check all files are added to git-repo, means these files r ready to be commited at my git-repo]
>git commit -m "first commit"  (enter)  [commit the current status(changes) of our folder to git-repo, after *-m* putting message there]

>$ rm -f ./.git/index.lock    [to delete this file, if any error shows on that file already exists]
>git log --oneline   [7-digit code, shows log(only 1st-few chars of commit-number) of allcommmits put in git-repo, can use --getlog  also]

after modifying any file, just type:
>git add .    [will add all files of current dir to git-repo] and then check status(will show modified files)

>git commit -m "second commit"   [2nd commit made]
